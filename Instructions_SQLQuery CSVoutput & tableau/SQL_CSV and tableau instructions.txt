These instructions allow me to generate output from SQL query in CSV format
1-\pset format csv
2-\o 'D:/titanic/DataAnalysis/output.csv'(path where I want these output files)
3-my SQLquery
4-\o

Tableau instructions
1-Columns->Categories like xaxis
2-Rows->Quantities, like yaxis
3-Colors->to differentiate categories.
4-Filter->to toggle values in a category(eg:sex category see all males or all females) and see changes. (need to turn on show filter)
5-file name pill in measured values section, means number of rows, can be used to count. (eg:all passengers=all rows)
6-Clicking a portion of the graph(like a bar from bar graph) results in the value getting displayed at bottom of page. Detail from Marks section and other options in the mark section can also be used.

Approach I used:

1-Goal/Business problem: Find out what groups of people had higher survival rates.
2-Summary statistics:Get an overview based on our goal. 

Like how many people survived,how many did not. 

Which groups of people(sex,pclass,age) had highest percentage of survivors.

3-Visualise the data:Use tools like tableau to visualize, so we can understand easily

which groups had higher survival rates. Toggle sex(male,female),pclass(1,2,3) or visualise all together to compare and find out which groups had higher survival rates.
